## Files Structure
The majority of the folders, except for Actor-Critic and Reinforce, contain 3 files that generally have the same code, with only small variations tailored to a specific task.
- **`train_sb3.py`**: The main script for training and testing RL agents. It includes various configurable options via command-line arguments.
- **`env/custom_hopper.py`**: Contains the definition of the custom environment "Custom Hopper".
- **`UDR.py`**: Defines the callback for domain randomization.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Gym
- Stable Baselines3 (`PPO`, `SAC`)
- PyTorch
- TensorBoard

## train_sb3.py arguments 
1.**`--train-timesteps`**
   - Description: Specifies the number of timesteps for which the agent should be trained.
   - Type: int
   - Default value: None (if not specified)

2.**`--outName`**
   - Description: The output filename for saving the trained model. If not specified, a name will be generated automatically based on other parameters.
   - Type: str
   - Default value: None

3.**`--model`**
   - Description: Specifies the file from which to load a pre-trained model. It can be a specific file or values like best (for the best model) or final (for the final model).
   - Type: str
   - Default value: None

4.**`--test-episodes`**
   - Description: Number of episodes to use for testing the model. This parameter is useful for evaluating the performance of the trained model.
   - Type: int
   - Default value: 2000

5.**`--algorithm`**
   - Description: Specifies the reinforcement learning algorithm to use for training. Available options are PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) and SAC (Soft Actor-Critic).
   - Type: str
   - Default value: PPO

6.**`--render`**
   - Description: If specified, enables rendering of the simulation during the testing phase, allowing you to visualize the agent's execution.
   - Type: bool
   - Default value: False

7.**`--device`**
   - Description: Specifies the device on which to run the training. It can be cpu for running on the processor or cuda for running on a GPU.
   - Type: str
   - Default value: cpu

8.**`--DR`**
   - Description: Type of Domain Randomization to apply during training. Currently supports UDR (Uniform Domain Randomization) or None if no randomization is desired.
   - Type: str
   - Default value: None

9.**`--range`**
   - Description: Specifies the range for Uniform Domain Randomization (UDR). This parameter is used to define the variation range applied to the environment parameters during training.
   - Type: float
   - Default value: 5

10.**`--mass`**
    - Description: Specifies the mass to use for domain randomization. It determines the mass value that varies the environment's dynamics during training.
    - Type: int
    - Default value: None

## Fine-tuning (Optuna)
For models where hyperparameter fine-tuning has been implemented, the optuna.db files contain the logs of the trials conducted by the Optuna tool.
Optuna is an open-source  and versatile hyperparameter optimization framework designed to automate the process of tuning machine learning models. 
For more information, visit the [Optuna GitHub repository](https://github.com/optuna/optuna).

## Sobol 
The code is designed to handle large-scale evaluations by splitting the workload into batches and distributing them across multiple processes. This ensures that even with an increased number of parameters, the computation time remains manageable.
The computational cost can be approximately identified as : 
`O(N Ã— m / p)`
Where N is the number of samples ,m is the number of parameters and p is the number of processes.
In this way, it becomes feasible to leverage Sobol sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters that are most beneficial to randomize. This approach is particularly valuable because training a model with domain randomization is generally more computationally expensive. By focusing on the parameters that have the greatest impact on the model's performance, you can optimize the randomization process, thereby improving the efficiency of training and reducing unnecessary computational costs.
